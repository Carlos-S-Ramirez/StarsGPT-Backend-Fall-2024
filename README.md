This repository contains the majority of my contributions to our senior final project, a tutoring-focused chatbot platform.

I was responsible for building the initial user login page and model selection system, implementing both frontend and backend logic. I also handled the API chaining and conversation memory logic to store and display user-chatbot interactions.

Additionally, I designed and implemented the Singleton-based model handler, which manages prompt injection and ensures consistent chatbot behavior across sessions. This includes structuring system prompts and logic to guide the chatbot's responses based on our tutoring requirements.

Main Contributions:
